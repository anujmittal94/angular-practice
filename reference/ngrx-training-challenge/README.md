# NgRx Workshop

## Setup

To get started, ensure that you have _at least_ Node v12 installed. You can verify what version you have installed by running

```sh
node --version
```

from your terminal. Then, fork this repository to your personal Github account. As you make changes to the codebase during this workshop you will be pushing your changes to your personal fork. You can [learn more about forks here](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo).

Once you have forked this repository, clone your fork to your development machine. Then run the following command using your terminal from the root of the repository to install dependencies.

```sh
npm install
```

With the dependencies installed run the app to verify everything is working correctly.

## Running the app

To run the app execute the following command from your terminal:

```sh
npm start
```

Then in another terminal run:

```sh
npm run backend
```

The app should now be running at [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200)
